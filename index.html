      <p id="hiddenParagraph">ROCK : The rock is when you place your hand into the form of a simple fist. <br>
        PAPER : The paper is when you place your hand in an outstretched position. <br>
        SCISSORS : This is when you hold your fist with your index and middle finger pointing outwards in a V shape. <br>
       <b>The Basic Rules of RPS</b> <br>
        Despite its underlying complexity, the gameâ€™s rules are straightforward. <br>
        Players deliver hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors, <br>
        with the outcome determined by these three rules:
        1. Rock wins against scissors.
        2. Scissors win against paper.
        3. Paper wins against rock.
